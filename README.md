# Network-Analysis-Lab

## Objective

The Network Analysis Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to analyze and monitor network security within Snort, Zeek, and Wireshark, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Project 1: Brute-Force (Snort)

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of IDS/IPS concepts.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Advanced understanding of writing Snort rules.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- IDS/IPS.
- Network analysis tools (such as Snort,Wireshark,Zeek) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
